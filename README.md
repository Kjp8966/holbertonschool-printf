This is a group project done by my partner (Fox Galileo) and myself. We are to write a printf function handling the conversion specifiers c, %, s, d, and i.
Tasks:
0. Write a function that produces output according to a format. For c, s, %.
1. Handle the following conversion specifiers: d and i.
2. Create a man page for your function.
